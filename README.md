# CFB FGs

This project tracks the play-by-play of field goals during the 2022 college football season. The goal is to practice gathering data, communicating with data, and learning some things along the way.

It's built using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites), the [cfbfastR](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/cfbfastR) package, and [fly.io](https://fly.io/).


#### What this project includes: 

-   play-by-play for every field goal in college football for the 2022 FBS season
-   field goal leaderboard by team and player (kicker)

#### What it does NOT include:

-   any other play-by-play data or kicking data (no punts, extra points, kickoffs, or blocked returns)
-   any previous seasons of data (only 2022 right now)
-   any proprietary models (only raw observed data)
-   the leaderboard page is only for FBS schools (FCS schools not included)
